# ML Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my own implementations of classical machine learning
algorithms in C++. This project is meant to primarily serve an educational
purpose as I can refresh my C++ skills and I need to recap the details and
intricacies of each algorithm. I have become so used to just import models
from libraries (especially in python) that I thought it would be nice think
a bit harder again about what is going on under the hood.
